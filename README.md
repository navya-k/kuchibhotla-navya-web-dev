Showcasing my work for a Web Development Course at Northeastern University.

Two web applications include:

1. Thrill Camp :
   An app that let's you hunt and explore events around an area based on your search criteria. Sign up and you can manage your 
   favourite events.
	
2. Web App Maker :
   Web App Maker allows users to create and use online, mobile friendly, Websites. Users can create Websites. 
   There are two types of users. Those who can create Websites as developers and end users who visit the Websites created by the 
   developers. Only developers can create and modify the Websites. End users can not modify the Websites, they can only interact 
   with them. Websites can contain multiple pages which in turn contain various kinds of widgets.
